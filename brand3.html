      <h2>History</h2>

      <h3>Origin Story</h3>
      <p>
        Off-White (stylized as OFF-WHITE c/o VIRGIL ABLOH) is an Italian luxury fashion label founded by American designer Virgil Abloh. The company was incorporated in Milan in 2012.[2]
        The label has collaborated with Nike, Levi, Jimmy Choo, IKEA and Évian.[3]

        The company was first founded as "PYREX VISION" by Virgil Abloh in the Italian city of Milan in 2012.[2] This name was abandoned after Pyrex Vision came under criticism when it was discovered that the label was simply printing "PYREX 23" on Ralph Lauren rugby flannel tops, then reselling them for a premium $550 price tag.[4] Abloh then rebranded the company as Off-White, which he describes as "the grey area between black and white as the color off-white" to the fashion world.[5] It has shown collections at Paris Fashion Week shows, and is sold in retail stores in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Milan, London and New York.[5]

        In August 2019, José Neves, owner of Farfetch, purchased New Guards Group, the parent organization of Off-White for US$675 million.[6]
